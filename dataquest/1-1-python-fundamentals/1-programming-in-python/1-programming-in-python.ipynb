    "There are multiple definitions of a data engineer that you can find around the web, but at Dataquest we have our own that we believe best fits the role. For us, a data engineer's responsibility is to build the architecture for a data platform that enables data analysts, scientiest, and other curious types to query their data without worry. Essentially, a data engineer needs to have the skills to build a data pipeline that connects all the pieces of the data ecosystem together and keep it up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data engineering is the first -- and arguably most crucial -- step for a successful data strategy. Data engineers make sure data scientists have the data they need to perform data science. They're responsible for:\n",
    "- Accessing, collecting, auditing, and cleaning data from applications and systems into a usable state.\n",
    "- Creating and maintaining efficient databases.\n",
    "- Building data pipelines.\n",
    "- Monitoring and managing systems, including [distributed systems](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/distribs.htm).\n",

    "Data engineers are responsible for the bottom two rows and also play a big role in the third row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data engineers' and data scientists' skills have some overlap at the boundaries of each role's knowledge, but they specialize in different things. For instance, given that data engineers are software engineers who work with data technologies, programming is the largest part of their training and workload, whereas data scientists ideally only program for analysis and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start our journey by learning about programming. More specifically, we'll learn about programming in Python. This will be our main focus for this course and the next. In later courses, we'll build on this programming knowledge to learn how to create databases, and other data engineering skills"
