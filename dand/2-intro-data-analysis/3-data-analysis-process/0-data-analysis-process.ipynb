You gather the data you need to answer your questions, assess your data to identify any problems in your data’s quality or structure, and clean your data by modifying, replacing, or removing data to ensure that your dataset is of the highest quality and as well-structured as possible."

Or, if your end goal is to build a system, you usually need to share what you’ve built, explain how you reached design decisions, and report how well it performs. There are many ways to communicate your results: reports, slide decks, blog posts, emails, presentations, or even conversations. Data visualization will always be very valuable."
